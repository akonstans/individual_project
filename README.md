# Individual Project

# Project Overview
This project is intended to be a time series analysis of 4 tech stocks(Apple, Google, Netflix, and Amazon) to create a predictive model to determine future stock prices. The end result is hopefully a model capable of predicting 4 stocks at once and be used to determine portential market trends. The first iteration of the model will be using just 1 stock at a time to predict future price.

# Project Goals
- To predict stock price with accuracy higher than a baseline given two years of prior data
- Create a model using 1 stock to determine future prices
- Create a model using all 4 stocks to determine future trends
- To use all 4 stocks in a time series at once and be able to use the predicitions to infer market trends in the tech industry
- Deliver a report on the project
